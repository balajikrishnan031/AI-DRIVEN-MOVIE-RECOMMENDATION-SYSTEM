🧩 1. Problem Statement
•	In the era of digital streaming, the vast amount of content overwhelms users, making it difficult to choose the right movie.
•	Traditional recommendation systems often fail to deliver highly personalized and socially interactive experiences.
•	This project proposes an AI-driven system that recommends movies based on user preferences and matches users with similar tastes, enhancing the social dimension of movie discovery.
🎯 2. Objectives of the Project
•	Develop a hybrid movie recommendation system combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning.
•	Build a user profiling module to analyze viewing history, genre preferences, emotional reactions, and behaviors.
•	Implement an AI-powered matchmaking system to link users with psychological and behavioral similarity.
•	Provide explainable recommendations that adapt based on real-time user feedback.
•	Enhance interactive and social movie discovery through intelligent user matching.

🔭 3. Scope of the Project

      Features to Implement:
•	Hybrid recommendation system (content-based + collaborative filtering + deep learning)
•	Dynamic user profiling
•	User-matching algorithm based on similarity
•	Command-Line Interface (CLI) application (expandable to GUI/Web later)
•	Real-time feedback loop for continuous improvement
    Limitations:
•	Initial prototype as CLI (not full web app).
•	Small dataset for prototyping (no large-scale deployment).
•	Focus on movies only (no TV shows, music, books).
•	No use of user demographic details (age, location, etc.).

🗂️ 4. Data Resources
•	Movie Data Source: Kaggle MovieLens Dataset
o	Features: Movie metadata (genres, actors, directors, tags, ratings)
•	User Data Source: Synthetic user profiles
o	Features: Viewing history, ratings, genre preferences, behavioral patterns
•	Dataset Nature: Static (downloaded once and used locally)





🛠️ 5. High-Level Methodology
📥 Data Collection
•	Fetch movie data from Kaggle MovieLens dataset.
•	Generate synthetic user profiles with logical viewing patterns.
🧹 Data Cleaning
•	Handle missing values (like missing director names).
•	Normalize text fields (e.g., lowercase genres).
•	Remove duplicates.
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Analyze most-watched genres.
•	Study relationship between user ratings and genres.
•	Explore viewing habits via user clustering.
🧬 Feature Engineering
•	Create user preference vectors and movie feature vectors.
•	Build user similarity matrices for matchmaking.
🧠 Model Building
•	Content-Based Filtering for initial recommendations.
•	Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization) for user-based recommendations.
•	Deep Learning models (Neural Networks) for non-linear user behavior.
•	Clustering (K-means) to group users with similar preferences.

✅ Model Evaluation
•	RMSE for rating prediction accuracy.
•	Precision@k and Recall@k for recommendation quality.
•	Silhouette Score for clustering evaluation.

📈 Visualization & Interpretation
•	Precision-Recall curves.
•	2D visualizations using PCA/t-SNE for clustering.
•	Flow diagrams showing user interactions.

🚀 Deployment
•	Initially deploy as a CLI application.
•	Future possibility: Upgrade to Streamlit or Flask-based web app.

🧰 6. Tools and Technologies

💻 Programming Language
•	Python

📒 Notebook/IDE

•	Docker (for advanced deployment)

📊 7. Results & Visualization (Future Phase)
•	Graphs showing recommendation accuracy.
•	Visual clustering of users.
•	Example recommendation lists per user.

🧠 8. Conclusion & Future Work

•	Proposed a hybrid AI-based movie recommendation system.
•	Enhanced recommendation quality through dynamic learning and user matchmaking.
•	Future extensions:
o	Expand to real-time feedback learning.
o	Develop a full GUI/Web-based platform.
o	Integrate with larger streaming datasets.
